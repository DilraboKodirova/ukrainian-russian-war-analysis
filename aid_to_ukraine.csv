DKM8,Denmark,1/7/2023,Military,Weapons,"Denmark enters a cooperation with Germany and the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with Leopard-1A5 main battle tanks. Accoring to the official source, the exact number of tanks Denmark will provide is not yet known. The tanks are supposed to be purchased from German industry stocks. Source of Aid 2 cites a journalist that states a value of €130 million for this entire package. The package will not only include the tanks, but also different services like training, ammunition, and logistics. Adding €130 million to our value for the Danish military aid until now coincides with the official Danish total value given by their website. We therefore report this Leopard-1 aid package here with a value of €130 million, but leave the number of donated tanks open until further notice.

In September 2022, during an interview with Spiegel, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that Poland donated 300 tanks in total (Source of aid 2). Since Poland previously donated 240 T-72 tanks and yet an unknown amount of PT-91 Twardy, we assume, based on this statement, that the amount of PT-91 donated is 60. Later in February, Polish Prime Minister stated the different amount of tanks donated, which was ""250 tanks... or even more than that"" (Source of aid 3). Since there is no other official source, we have to rely on the most recent information, which is 250 total tanks provided in total. We also assume that ""even more"" could not refer to a critical amount and thus stick to 250. Therefore, we decrease the amount of PT-91 to 10 (250-240).
